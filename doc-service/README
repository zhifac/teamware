BUILDING
========

1. Review/edit your "build.properties" file located in this project root
   directory.

 - Set "catalina.home" and "gate.home" in the file to point at your Tomcat and
   GATE installations.
 - If you want to used GATE datastore other than default one change properties:
      ds.location=file:${user.home}/safe/docservice-ds/datastore
      ds.index.location=file:${user.home}/safe/docservice-ds/index

2. Run ant build. Simply running "ant" should compile the code and create a
   .war file suitable for deploying to tomcat.

3. Put the generated .war file in tomcat's webapps directory.

4. You can check docservice installation with URL:
   http://YourServerName:port/docservice

for particular projects. To make custom build use following command:
