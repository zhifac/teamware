GaS Service Definition Tool
===========================

This is a Swing-based tool for creating and editing GaS service definition XML
files.  It allows you to edit a service definition with respect to a particular
GATE application, so for example the PR parameters to which you can map a GaS
parameter are restricted to those that actually occur in the application.

There is a "run" target in the Ant build file to run the tool.

Developer note:
---------------

The GUI was built with Abeille Forms Designer (https://abeille.dev.java.net/),
and the *Form.java files were auto-generated by the designer, so it's not a
good idea to try and edit them by hand.  The Java files are pretty
human-readable, but your changes will get overridden next time the file is
regenerated.  To edit the forms, open the project file (project.jfpr) in the
designer, then open the *.xml file for the form, make your changes, then use
Tools/Code generation to regenerate the Java file.
