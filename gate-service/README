GATE Service (GaS)
------------------

This directory contains the various components of the GaS.  There are several
subdirectories, the most important are:

server:  The server-side implementation of a GaS
gate-client:  The PR to support calling a GaS from GATE.

Each subdirectory builds independently, and if you are an Eclipse user you must
create a separate project for each.  For best results, use the following
project names:

server:  create an Eclipse project called "GAS-server"
gate-client:  create an Eclipse project called "GASPR"

Don't try and create a project for gate-service itself, this won't work.
