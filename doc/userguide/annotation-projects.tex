\section{Introduction}
\emph{Project Management} functionality is accessible to the \emph{manager} and \emph{administrator} roles
only. Managers can access and modify content created by themselves only, while administrators can see and edit all content available in the system.

From the home page you
can either use available shortcuts, or you can access even more options from the
\emph{Projects} menu on the top. As a manager you will see options as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:manager-home-page}, while as an administrator you will see more options (see Figure~\ref{fig:admin-home-page}).

\end{figure}


\emph{Annotation projects} are meant to support the following annotation
modules: 

 \begin{itemize}
   \item \emph{automatic}
   \item \emph{manual}
   \item \emph{post-manual (consensus)}
   \item \emph{review}
   \item \emph{post-processing (final consensus)}
 \end{itemize}

You can use any particular module or all of them in the predefined order.
If you want use \emph{manual} or \emph{review} module, you will be able to manage
annotators and curators and specify annotation rules. 

In case of \emph{automatic}, \emph{post-manual}  or \emph{post-processing} 
mode you can choose from existing GATE services (GAS) which can be executed in
sequence. Please see the \emph{Annotation Services} chapter for more details. 

The motivation for combining all modules is to use pre-processing to
bootstrap the manual annotation process. The result of
manual annotation result is consolidated by using post-manual module, in other
words the annotation sets created by human annotators, e.g. \emph{annotator1/2}
are inspected and merged. The identical annotations are moved to \emph{consensus} annotation set and the
different ones are left in \emph{annotator1/2}.
Review process should validate the annotations in \emph{annotator1/2} and
delete false ones. This will leave only reviewed annotations in
\emph{annotator1/2}.

Finally, the remaining - valid annotations in \emph{annotator1/2} are copied to
\emph{consensus} set by post-processing module.

\section{Create new WF template}\label{section:create-new-template}
\input{create-new-template}

\section{My WF templates}\label{section:wf-templates}
Choose \emph{Projects Menu $>>$My Workflow Templates} option from the top menu
or \emph{My Workflow Templates} link at your home page.
You will enter \emph{My WF Templates} page as shown in Figure
~\ref{fig:mywftemplates}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{mywftemplates}
\caption{My Workflow Templates}
\label{fig:mywftemplates}
\end{figure}
As we have mentioned previously in Section~\ref{section:create-new-template},
you will land on this page after finishing wizard successfully. In this case,
the status of workflow template will be \emph{Ready}, meaning that you can
create project based on this template (the \emph{Create Project} icon will be
visible only if the template is ready). If during the wizard you quit the
process before finishing template setup, the status of the template will be
\emph{Not Configured}. By clicking on \emph{Resume} icon, you will be able to
resume the setup and complete unfinished steps.

If you want to delete a \emph{Workflow Template}, you can do so by clicking on
the \emph{Delete} icon. Note that all projects based on selected template will
be deleted.

Of course, you will often need to check what configuration is saved in template.
This can be done by hovering \emph{I} icon.

\section{Create new project}\label{section:create-new-project}

For your convenience, there are several ways to create project.
Two have been already mentioned:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item from the corpora list page, you can create project for the specified
corpus by clicking on \emph{Start Project} icon (see
Section~\ref{section:corpora-list}).
   \item from the My Workflow Templates page, you can create project for the
specified template by clicking on \emph{New project} icon (see
Section~\ref{section:wf-templates}).
 \end{itemize}
 
 Here we will cover other ways.
 
From the top menu select "Projects" $>>$ "New Project", or access it 
  directly from the home page. You will be redirected to \emph{Create New 
  Project} page where you need to choose \emph{WF Template}. Here
  you have two options (see Figure~\ref{fig:createnewproject}):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choose from the list of available templates and click \emph{Select}.
    \item Create new template, by selecting option \emph{Blank template}.
    If you choose this option, you will need to follow the steps explained
    in Section ~\ref{section:create-new-template}. 
    After you have finished creating the template, you will be redirected to
    the list of WF templates.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{createnewproject}
\caption{Create New Project}
\label{fig:createnewproject}
\end{figure}
You will be redirected to the \emph{Project Data} page where you need to 
provide details of the project. Requested details vary depending on the
annotation modes defined in the WF template. In case you excluded manual
annotation mode, the three options will need to be selected (see
Figure~\ref{fig:projectdata}): project name,
corpus, and manager (you will be selected by default); as a manager of the
project you will be able to see this project in \emph{My projects} list and
manage it (e.g., change actors, monitor project).
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.34]{projectdata}
\caption{Configure Project without Manual Annotation}
\label{fig:projectdata}
\end{figure}

When \emph{manual annotation} module is defined, there will be two options in
addition to the previously selected ones: curators and annotators
(see Figure~\ref{fig:projectdatamanual}).
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.34]{projectdatamanual}
\caption{Configure Project with Manual Annotation}
\label{fig:projectdatamanual}
\end{figure}
For example, you can leave yourself as \emph{manager} and \emph{curator}, and
you can select as many annotators as you wish in the list (hold Ctrl while
selecting annotators for multiple selection of actors).

On the other hand, if you chose \emph{review} module and ommit \emph{manual
annotation} module, there will be an option to select only curators and manager,
since annotators do not take part in review process.

Click \emph{Save \& Start} button and the annotation project will be started.

\section{Annotation Tasks}\label{section:annotation-tasks}

If used template contains manual annotation module all annotators should be
able to get annotation tasks after logging in and clicking on \emph{Open Annotation Editor} from the home page.
We now discuss how annotators (users with \emph{annotator} role execute their
tasks and annotate documents.

As a general rule, users with \emph{Annotator} role assigned, participate in
the project via annotation editor. The annotator's home page contains restricted
operations as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:annotatorhomepage}. The annotator can
either open Annotator editor, or edit his/her profile.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{annotatorhomepage}
\caption{Annotator Home Page}
\label{fig:annotatorhomepage}
\end{figure}

After clicking on \emph{Open annotation editor} link, the annotator has to ask
for the new task. To do this, s/he needs to click on the \emph{Get New Task}
button (the first one from the left side).
Annotation Editor will start to search for available tasks and the annotator
will see the dialogue similar to one shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:getnewtaskineditor}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{getnewtaskineditor}
\caption{Searching for a new task in Annotation Editor}
\label{fig:getnewtaskineditor}
\end{figure}

If there is an available task, it will be loaded in annotation editor.
The following actions are available (see Figure
~\ref{fig:annotationtaskineditor}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Finish task (click on the second button from the left) when you finished
with annotations.
  \item Save task (click on the third button from the left) when you want to
save your annotations, but not finish the task.
  \item Reject Task (click on the fourth button from the left) when you feel
unsure how to annotate document and want this to be assigned to other annotator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{annotationtaskineditor}
\caption{Get New Task in Annotation Editor}
\label{fig:annotationtaskineditor}
\end{figure}

\section{Curation Tasks}\label{section:curation-tasks}
If used template contains \emph{review} module all chosen curators (remember,
you had to select them during project startup) should be able to get curation
tasks after logging in and clicking on \emph{Group Tasks} from the
\emph{Projects Menu} likd shown in Figure~\ref{fig:curator-home-page}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{curator-home-page}
\caption{Project menu for curators}
\label{fig:curator-home-page}
\end{figure}

Now we will explain how curator claims and executes his/her tasks and review
documents.

In general, users with \emph{Curator} role assigned, participate in
the project through task form. Since, more than one curator can be assigned to
a particular project, it is necessary for curator to claim his/ger task first,
by clicking on \emph{Accept} icon (see Figure~\ref{fig:reviewgrouptask}). 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{reviewgrouptask}
\caption{Group Tasks}
\label{fig:reviewgrouptask}
\end{figure}

That task will be moved then from \emph{Group Task List} to his/her
\emph{Personal Task list}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:acceptedreviewtask} 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{acceptedreviewtask}
\caption{My Tasks}
\label{fig:acceptedreviewtask}
\end{figure}

Curator then executes the task by clicking on \emph{Start} icon.
He will be shown the task form with the instructions which he/she needs to
follow - Figure~\ref{fig:reviewtask} 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{reviewtask}
\caption{Review Task}
\label{fig:reviewtask}
\end{figure}. 

The review procedure briefly comprises the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Download corpus you need to review as a zip archive, by clicking on
  \emph{Corpus}
  \item Unpack the zip archive and copy documents somewhere on your hard drive
  \item Launch GATE Developer, create new corpus and populate it with the
  unzipped documents.
  \item Run Corpus QA tools (IAA, Annotation Diff, etc) to find out to which
  extent how annotators agree. Note that Corpus QA Tools are added in GATE 5.1.
  \item Delete annotations that you consider false from human annotation sets,
  e.g. \emph{annotator1/2}.
  \item Go back to Teamware, find your task among \emph{My Tasks} and update the
  documents in corpus by clicking on \emph{Upload Corpus} link.
  \item Press \emph{Finish} button in your task form.
\end{itemize}

As a manager you will have more responsibilities than curators and annotators.
One, especially worth mentioning is that managers will be able to manage
projects and have insight into the project progress at any time. In the
following sections we will provide more details on this.

\section{My Projects}
To manage project, select \emph{Projects $>>$ My Projects} from the top menu.
You will see the list of projects that you have created/started, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:myprojects}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{myprojects}
\caption{My Projects}
\label{fig:myprojects}
\end{figure}
For each project, there are several available options (four icons next to the
Status field as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:myprojects}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{view processes} for the particular project,
  \item \texttt{suspend/resume} the project,
  \item \texttt{change the project actors}: managers, curators, annotators,
  \item \texttt{end} the project,
  \item \texttt{delete} the project.
\end{itemize}
Besides that, after project is completed, you will be notified by email.
All these options are described in detail in the following subsections.

\subsection{Project Processes}
In order to see project processes, click on \emph{Processes} icon (red and 
green icon, see Figure~\ref{fig:myprojects}) for the specific project listed in
the \emph{My Projects} page.
The process list will be shown as in Figure~\ref{fig:processesinproject}:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{processesinproject}
\caption{Project Processes}
\label{fig:processesinproject}
\end{figure}:
From the \emph{Processes} page, you can:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{see the status} of each process (started, suspended or
completed),
  \item \texttt{monitor processes} by clicking on \emph{Process Monitoring}
icon. For
details on process monitoring console see details in Section
~\ref{section:process-monitoring}.
  \item \texttt{view tasks} created for each process by clicking on \emph{View
Tasks} icon (see Figure~\ref{fig:taskinstances}).
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{taskinstances}
\caption{Task List}
\label{fig:taskinstances}
\end{figure}
When annotators start to annotate, you will be able to see the list of tasks and
their status. For example, if there are 2
documents in the corpus and 2 annotators are assigned to annotate each document,
there will be 4 tasks in total as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taskinstances}.
In this example, one annotator finished task, the other annotator accepted the task,
and two left tasks have not been taken yet.
From the Task List page you can also see who is the assigned user, and start and
end times for specific tasks.
Should you want to finish or cancel annotator task, you can do that by
clicking on relevant icons. These actions correspond to \emph{canceling
document annotation} and \emph{returning document to the pool} respectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Suspend/Resume Project}
 A project can be suspended at any time, by clicking on \emph{Suspend} icon.
This means that all processes and tasks in that project will be suspended.
The project can be resumed later, which analogly will result in resuming
its processes and tasks.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:suspendproject}:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{suspendproject}
\caption{Suspend Project}
\label{fig:suspendproject}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Change Project Actors}
There is often a need to change actors during project execution.
For example, you might want to pass manager role to someone else or to change
curators and annotators due to some changes in personnel. This option is
available in GATE Teamware.
From the \emph{My Projects} page you need to click on \emph{Change Actors} icon
for the specific project, and you will be redirected to the page where you can
change all actors as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:changeprojectactors}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{changeprojectactors}
\caption{Change Project Actors}
\label{fig:changeprojectactors}
\end{figure}
As it is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:changeprojectactors}, the current
actors will be preselected.

\subsection{End Project}
 A project can be ended at any time, by clicking on \emph{End} icon (the first
 on the right). This means that all processes and tasks in that project will be
 ended. The project cannot be resumed later. This option is useful if manager wants to 
stop the work on the project, but leave the project history intact.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:endproject}:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{endproject}
\caption{End Project}
\label{fig:endproject}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Delete Project}
With time, the number of your projects will increase, therefore we provide the
option to delete old projects.
It is not restricted only to completed projects, so you can delete even 
running projects. Deleting a project will also delete the
corresponding processes and tasks.

\subsection{Email Notification}
As a manager you will be notified by email, upon your project completion.
This can be very useful, if you are not actively monitoring execution.
The example of email you can expect is shown on
Figure~\ref{fig:projectcompletednotification}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{projectcompletednotification}
\caption{Project Completed Notification}
\label{fig:projectcompletednotification}
\end{figure}
\input{process-monitoring}
