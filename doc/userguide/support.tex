This chapter details Support module which includes: forum, chat and tutorials.
\section{Forum}
GATE Teamware includes forum powered by \url{http://www.jforum.net}.
The complete list of features is available at:
\url{http://www.jforum.net/features.jsp}.

The forum is envisaged to serve as the primary way for interactive support, instead of mailing list.
As with any advanced forum, users can post new messages and replies, or create new topics. 

Figure~\ref{fig:forum} depicts the main forum page with list of available forums. 

Feel free to use this forum to post any particular questions, report bugs and suggest any new features for the GATE Teamware.
