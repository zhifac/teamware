<p>
In the context of semantic webs or other conceptual knowledge management
models, annotation is the glue that ties ontologies into document spaces.
Without annotation the conceptual model and the Internet or intranet are
disconnected.

<a name="3.2."><h3>3.2. Why? (2) Service-Oriented Architectures</h3></a>


<p>
The TAO story, which motivates annotation because we use it in the
transitioning process

<p>
Semantic Web Services (SWS), and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) that
host them, will make a significant contribution to the competitiveness of
European ICT in the coming period. This will happen in two ways. First,
Enterprise Applications Integration (EAI) will become less costly and more
reliable because of explicit modelling of the meaning of data and processes
in the systems owned by different business units. Second, B2B and B2C
eCommerce systems will become:
<ul>
<li>
more reusable, with interfaces that are meaningful for machines as well as
  for humans;
</li>
<li>
more dynamic and adaptive, with the possibility of virtual applications
  composed from dynamically discovered components;
</li>
<li>
more scaleable, distributed across multiple machines;
</li>
<li>
saleable as discreet elements in the application service providers market.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
TAO is about how existing legacy applications can migrate to open,
semantics-based SOA.

<a name="3.3."><h3>3.3. Why? (3) The Return of the Librarian?</h3></a>


<p>
Some decades ago, if the chief engineer of a Sheffield steelworks needed to
know the value of some constant in the equations describing the mixture of
ingredients for a specialist job, he'd phone the city library. Even now, if
you work for a large corporation you may well be able to call on the
services of a skilled information scientist whose job is to know more about
navigating the published universe than any normal mortal could ever learn.

<p>
These skills are less and less available. The winding down of the welfare
state public service in favour of private profit has closed a thousand
libraries, and the information firehose has cheapened information to the
degree that the little query box on Google's search page has become the only
investigative tool for many.

<p>
GATE has been around long enough to be around the first hit for "gate" on
Google and Yahoo.

<p>
KIM from OntoText, 

<p>
Applications include providing conceptual search over entities and simple
relations extracted from news text relative to the PROTON ontology.
Functions:
<ul>
<li>
answer questions like "show me all news relating to telecoms companies in
  Eastern Europe"
</li>
<li>
in an EPG context answer queries like "find programmes which are
  non-fiction, made between 1989 and 1995, and involve locations in Eastern
  Europe"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Evaluated as the leading semantic annotation tool at the eponymous workshop
at ISWC 2005.

<p>
<b>Deployment slide.</b>

<p>
How do we ensure that our applications fall under the curve?

<p>
There's been lots of research that attacks this problem from different
angles; the rest of the talk is about a synthesis of previous research in a
new framework.

<p>


<hr>
<a name="4.3."><h3>4.3. How? (3) From Annotation Tools to <em>Annotation Factories</em></h3></a>


<p>
We <b>have</b> lots and lots of tools and algorithms for annotation; what we
<b>need</b> is
<ol>
<li>
methodological instead of purely technological 
</li>
<li>
multi-role instead of single role
</li>
<li>
unifying previously disjoint annotation adaptation interventions
</li>
<li>
assistive instead of autonomous
</li>
<li>
diachronic, life-cycle orientated, not waterfall or "big bang" orientated
</li>
<li>
service-orientated, not monolithic
</li>
</ol>

<p>
GLEAM, the GATE Layer for Extraction, Annotation and Mining, is a software
suite and a methodology for the implementation and support of annotation
Factory services with the above characteristics.

<p>


<hr>
<a name="4.3.1."><h4>4.3.1. Annotation: the Missing Manual</h4></a>


<p>
Despite the breadth and depth of literature describing algorithms,
evaluation protocols and performance statistics for annotation the
technology lacks a clear statement of how to go about specifying and
implementing annotation functionality for a new task or domain.

<p>
The methodology will cover:
<ul>
<li>
how to decide if annotation is applicable to your problem
</li>
<li>
how to define the problem with reference to a corpus of examples
</li>
<li>
how to identify similarities with other problems and thence to estimate
  likely performance levels
</li>
<li>
how to design a balance of adaptation interventions for system setup and
  maintenance
</li>
<li>
how to measure success
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall the idea is not "get this great new bit of software and it will
transform your life" but "this is how to implement robust and maintainable
services" - i.e. less of the software and more of the method.

<p>


<hr>
<a name="4.3.2."><h4>4.3.2. A Division of Labour (Multi-role Methodology)</h4></a>


<p>
GATE has both a class library for programmers embedding LE in applications
and a development environment for skilled language engineers. GLEAM, however,
has to support a wider constituency of users. There are two main cases.

<p>
First, annotation of training data for learning algorithms should be a task
requiring little skill beyond that of a computer-literate person. That's a
requirement because training data volumes are typically large and therefore
the labour involved has to be cheap to make the process economic. For the
same reason the annotation environment should be as productive as possible,
for example by bootstrapping the annotation process with mixed-initiative
learning and by providing a voting mechanism for multiple simultaneous
annotators (this is necessary to guarantee quality with low-skilled staff).

<p>
Second, data curation or systems administration staff may become involved in
customising extraction systems. These types of people would take a training
course of a week or two, and be expected to use a richer toolset, perhaps
including things like ANNIC-based JAPE rule authoring.

<p>


<hr>
<a name="4.3.3."><h4>4.3.3. Unifying Adaptation Interventions for Custom Extraction Services (CuES)</h4></a>


<p>
Information Extraction (IE) is the process of automatically analysing text
(and, less often, speech) to populate fixed-format, unambiguous data
structures such as spreadsheets, link-analysis engines or databases. An IE
system is a dynamic object which represents a compromise between information
need and development cost. Almost never do the information need and the data
remain static. Therefore applications software using IE has to provide a
mechanism to tailor the extraction components to new information needs and to
new types of data. Up to now, no single mechanism has been discovered that
covers all cases, meaning that IE software has to support a wide spectrum of
adaptation interventions, from skilled computational linguists, through
content administrators and technical authors, to unskilled end-users
providing behavioural exemplars. In each area significant research streams
exist and have made good progress over the past decade or so. What has not
been done is to construct a unified environment in which all the different
adaptation interventions work together in a complementary manner.

<p>
The three principal mechanisms for IE adaptation in leading HLT research
streams are:
<ul>
<li>
assisted authoring of finite state transduction rules, including: generation
  of rules from annotation pattern searches across corpora (annotations in
  context); graphical debugging of transduction rule execution
</li>
<li>
supervised mixed-initiative learning of extraction models
</li>
<li>
unsupervised clustering of terms for purposes such as populating
  domain-specfic gazetteers
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, underlying the adaptation process are automated measurement and
visualisation tools, and frequency-based document search (or information
retrieval) tools. 

<p>


<hr>
<a name="4.3.4."><h4>4.3.4. Assistive vs. Autonomous</h4></a>


<p>
A modern factory engaged in the production of high-tech goods combines a
large degree of automation with skilled labour of various types and
quantities. Robots often play a significant role, although they are never
altogether unaccompanied: at the very least service engineers must attend
their operation, and in most cases there will also be staff who take care of
reconfiguring robotic equipment for new product lines or refinements to the
existing processes and products.
