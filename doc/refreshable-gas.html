<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."/><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Background</h1>

<p>This document decribes a possible approach to the problem of providing GATE web
services whose logic can be modified on the fly, without having to restart the
worker JVM.  This restarting process is particularly disruptive for all-in-one
service deployments, where the whole SAFE deployment runs in a single tomcat -
modifying the GaS currently requires a restart of the whole Tomcat server
process.</p>

<p>The basic act of getting a GaS to re-initialize itself is very simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get all the WorkerConfig beans out of the spring context.</li>
<li>For each WorkerConfig, call <tt>stop()</tt> on its JMS connection.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>when all the <tt>stop</tt> calls have returned, the workers have all been paused,
    and are not using their CorpusController instances.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Replace the CorpusController for each worker with a fresh copy from the
  spring context.</li>
<li>Re-<tt>init()</tt> the workers.</li>
<li><tt>start()</tt> the JMS connections again.</li>
<li>Dispose of the old controllers with <tt>Factory.deleteResource</tt> (for each PR,
  then the controller itself).</li>
</ul>

<p>Between the second and third steps it is possible to modify the gapp file or
the resource files it loads, in order to change the behaviour of the GaS.
For most services this will be fine, though there may be problems with the ML
services as currently implemented.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."/><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>Requirements (to discuss)</h1>

<p>Which of the following are required/desirable/not required?</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributing a new gapp file to workers (or just distributing changed
  resource files)?</li>
<li>Support for updating workers that are distributed (e.g. LDC), or just those
  where the workers and endpoint run in the same place (SK1)?</li>
<li>Support for services with &quot;cleverer&quot; configuration than just a simple gapp
  file?  For example, the ML service loads most of its application from a saved
  gapp but adds a couple of extra PRs that are created by the Spring context.
  More ideas on this below</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the following cannot be supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modifications to the Java classes of custom PRs or LRs used by the
  application (i.e. replacing the JAR).  This is due to the class loading model
  used by GATE, such changes require a server restart or at least a restart of
  the web application in which the worker is running.</li>
</ul>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."/><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Design ideas (a.k.a. Ian's note pad)</h1>

<p>Provide a new AdminService endpoint alongside the GATEService one, to avoid
polluting the standard GateWebService interface, and so we could potentially
add authentication/access control to the admin layer.</p>

<p>AdminService has an operation that takes a zip file (byte[], MTOM attachment)
containing replacement files for the GaS.</p>

<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>AdminService unzips new resources directly (if we only support refreshability
  for all-in-one services), or</li>
<li>Passes the zip to a JMS topic.  All worker VMs have an extra MDPOJO
  subscribed to this topic that receives and unzips the file.  Possibly reuse
  code from ML service model transfer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop/re-init/restart as above.</p>

<p>If we want to support editing of individual grammars/gaz lists, then we could
have a set of actions in the executive to allow online editing/upload of files
one at a time, then have exec package up the updates as a zip and pass them to
the GaS AdminService.</p>

<p>Note: the ML service presents different issues.  The way it works currently
is that when we start up tomcat (or the LDC processes) we first start up the
application-side workers which start listening on a JMS topic.  Then we start
up the training worker, which sends a copy of its latest model to this topic.
To get this to work across refreshes would mean we had to (a) stop the training
worker from accepting new tasks, (b) stop the application workers, (c) update
the data from the update zip file, (d) start the application workers and hope
they don't pick up any new tasks until after we've (e) started up the training
worker, to pass a valid model on to the application side.</p>

<p>Maybe we should just say ML services don't support refreshing (or at least
warn that YMMV).</p>

<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."/><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Support for non-prototype data in GaS</h1>

<p>Most GATE services we use create their applications in a prototype scoped
fashion, i.e. load a fresh copy of a gapp file for each worker.  The ML
services fit this pattern - though they create some of their PRs directly in
the Spring config and then add them to the end of the loaded gapp, these extra
PRs are still created with prototype scope.</p>

<p>However, what happens when we have services that share data between several
workers?  E.g. the NeOn SARDINE service has a singleton copy of an ontology
shared between several applications.  Do we want to support refresh in this
kind of case? </p>

<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a special &quot;refresh&quot; Spring scope and use this for shared objects.
  This scope would behave as &quot;singleton&quot; between refreshes, but we could then
  force all &quot;refresh&quot;-scoped beans to be re-created when the refresh action is
  called.</li>
<li>Go for a different approach - put worker beans and their dependencies in a
  child ApplicationContext, and replace that context entirely at refresh time.
  This will replace all the singleton beans in the sub-context as well as the
  prototype ones.</li>
</ul>
