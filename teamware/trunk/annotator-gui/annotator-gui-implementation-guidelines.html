<h1>Annotator GUI: implementation guidelines</h1>
<a name="section-1."/><h1>1. Overview</h1>

<p>The AnnotatorGui will be used by Human Annotators (HA) who can be located
anywhere in the world. The features of this GUI will be more restricted than
the full-fledged GATE GUI and provide features mainly for the annotation of
documents.</p>

<a name="section-2."/><h1>2. Architecture</h1>

<p>The AnnotatorGUI connects to an AnnotatorPool service which returns a list of
tasks to be achieved by the HA. The AnnotatorPool gets the documents from a
docservice and modifies them. Once the modifications have been finished, the
AnnotatorGUI informs the AnnotatorPool that the task has been completed.</p>

<a name="section-3."/><h1>3. Functionalities</h1>
<a name="section-3.1."/><h2>3.1. Installation</h2>

<p>The AnnotatorGUI will be implemented as a WebStart application
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/</a>). The application will have to
be signed in order to be able to connect to the web etc...  The application
will be installed on the user computer by accessing a link containing a jnlp
file (description of java webstart application). The application will be
automatically updated should a newer version be available on the server.</p>

<a name="section-3.2."/><h2>3.2. Login</h2>

<p>A HA has to be idenfied - the first screen will enable him to enter his
login/password but also the URL of the AnnotatorPool service. The
login/password will be checked on the AnnotatorPool service before going any
further. A checkbox will provide the possibility to store this information
locally and save the user the trouble of having to enter them every time. If
the AnnotatorPool service is not available or if the login/password is not
correct, an error message will be displayed on the interface.</p>

<a name="section-3.3."/><h2>3.3. Stack of tasks</h2>

<p>A task can be defined as a document to be annotated with regard to a set of
Named Entities or an Ontology. A task is defined minimally by:</p>
<ul>
<li>URL of a docservice</li>
<li>ID of a document</li>
<li>a priority</li>
<li>a set of parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>A task can be paused by a HA in which case the data are stored on the
docservice and can be resumed later. A task is completed when the changes have
been submitted to the docservice and some information is returned to the
AnnotatorPool. It is not possible to do any change to a document once it has
been completed - the reference will disappear from the stack of tasks.</p>

<a name="section-3.4."/><h2>3.4. Editor</h2>

<p>The editor will be derived from the existing GATE VR's. A main panel will
display the text of the document, a panel on the side will contain a list of
named entities or an ontology. The editor will have to be easily
configurable/pluggable/extendable in order to be customized for a specific
application. </p>
