<!-- 
One of the slides I gave yesterday morning refered to the difficult choices
that need to be made when you deploy language processing technology in
applications contexts. This talk is about work that we're doing using GATE
but reaching beyond GATE to make it easier to build useful software systems
that deal with annotating human language.
 -->

</div><div class="slide">
<a name="1."><h2>1. What GATE doesn't do</h2></a>


<p>
GATE helps...
<ul>
<li>
...scientists with:
<ul>
<li>
repeatability
</li>
<li>
quantitative evaluation
</li>
<li>
collaboration
</li>
<li>
apparatus longevity
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
...students and teachers with:
<ul>
<li>
working examples
</li>
<li>
bootstrapping projects
</li>
<li>
evaluation baselines
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
...application developers with:
<ul>
<li>
comprehensive standalone class library
</li>
<li>
visual debugging tools
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>But:</b>
<ul>
<li>
applications fall into patterns
</li>
<li>
domain-specific software architectures promote application-level reuse
</li>
<li>
language tech deployment requires a <b>process</b> as well as tools
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<a name="2."><h2>2. GLEAM: from Annotation Tools to <em>Annotation Factories</em></h2></a>


<p>
We <b>have</b> lots and lots of tools and algorithms for annotation; what we
<b>need</b> is
<ol>
<li>
methodological instead of purely technological 
</li>
<li>
multi-role instead of single role
</li>
<li>
inclusive of previously disjoint adaptation interventions
</li>
<li>
assistive instead of autonomous
</li>
<li>
diachronic, life-cycle orientated, not waterfall or "big bang" orientated
</li>
<li>
service-orientated, not monolithic
</li>
</ol>

<p>
GLEAM, the GATE Layer for Extraction, Annotation and Mining, is a software
suite and a methodology for the implementation and support of annotation
Factory services.

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<a name="2.1."><h3>2.1. Annotation: the Missing Manual</h3></a>


<p>
<!-- 
Despite the breadth and depth of literature describing algorithms -->


<p>
Processes vs. tools:
<ul>
<li>
much literature describing algorithms, evaluation protocols and
  performance statistics for annotation
</li>
<li>
no clear statement of how to go about specifying and implementing
  annotation for new tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The GLEAM methodology covers:
<ul>
<li>
how to decide if annotation is applicable to your problem
</li>
<li>
how to define the problem with reference to a corpus of examples
</li>
<li>
how to identify similarities with other problems and thence to estimate
  likely performance levels
</li>
<li>
how to design a balance of adaptation interventions for system setup and
  maintenance
</li>
<li>
how to measure success
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words:
<ul>
<li>
not "get this great new bit of software and it will transform your life" 
</li>
<li>
but "this is how to implement robust and maintainable services"
</li>
</ul>

<a name="2.2."><h3>2.2. A Division of Labour (Multi-role Methodology)</h3></a>


<p>
GATE has class libraries for <b>programmers</b> and an IDE for <b>skilled language
engineers</b>, but there are other cases:
<ol>
<li>
human annotators:
<ul>
<li>
training data volumes are typically large: the labour involved has to be
    cheap to be economic
</li>
<li>
annotation of training data for learning algorithms must require little
    skill
</li>
<li>
example techniques:
<ul>
<li>
bootstrapping the annotation process with mixed-initiative learning 
</li>
<li>
voting mechanism for multiple simultaneous annotators (QA)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
information curators:
<ul>
<li>
larger skill set than annotators but training requirements small enough
    to be in-house in small/medium sized organisations
</li>
<li>
librarians, data curation or sys admin staff after training course of a
    week or two
</li>
<li>
use a richer toolset including things like ANNIC-based JAPE rule
    authoring
</li>
<li>
managing and convening human annotators, liaising with engineers
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<a name="2.3."><h3>2.3. Unifying Adaptation Interventions</h3></a>

<ul>
<li>
problem: annotation systems are dynamic objects because the information
  need and the data don't remain static
</li>
<li>
therefore we need mechanisms for adaptation
</li>
<li>
three current research streams:
<ul>
<li>
assisted authoring of finite state transduction rules, including:
    generation of rules from annotation pattern searches across corpora
    graphical debugging of transduction rule execution
</li>
<li>
supervised mixed-initiative learning of extraction models
</li>
<li>
unsupervised clustering of terms for purposes such as populating
    domain-specfic gazetteers
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
GLEAM: a coordinated combination of these techniques 
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<a name="2.4."><h3>2.4. Assistive vs. Autonomous</h3></a>

<ul>
<li>
A modern factory engaged in the production of high-tech goods combines a
  large degree of automation with skilled labour of various types and
  quantities.
</li>
<li>
Robots often play a significant role, although they are never altogether
  unaccompanied:
<ul>
<li>
at the very least service engineers must attend their operation
</li>
<li>
in most cases there will also be staff who take care of reconfiguring
    robotic equipment for new product lines or refinements to the existing
    processes and products
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
GLEAM mixes automatic and assitive modes
</li>
</ul>

<a name="2.5."><h3>2.5. Iterative Processes vs. Waterfall or "Big Bang"</h3></a>


<p>
How to construct a failing software project:
<ul>
<li>
work for the government (optional)
</li>
<li>
define your plan as:
<ul>
<li>
first we (highly-paid developers) decide what to build (requirements)
</li>
<li>
then we (middle-level developers) decide how to build it (design)
</li>
<li>
then we (lower-level developers) implement it (coding)
</li>
<li>
then we (support staff) deploy it (disaster)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A better model:
<ol>
<li>
get a rough idea of what the client needs
</li>
<li>
decide on an element of 1. that we can do quickly
</li>
<li>
implement a set of tests that will succeed if we build 2.
</li>
<li>
build 2. until the tests work (adding more tests in the process and using
  a continuous integration tool)
</li>
<li>
give it to the user; go back to 1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The same with annotation: we need iterative methods that account for
changing needs and gradual refinement of requirements.

<p>

<a name="2.6."><h3>2.6. Service-Orientated, not Monolithic</h3></a>

<ul>
<li>
software has evolved: modules, objects, components, now services
</li>
<li>
increases decoupling and flexibility 
<ul>
<li>
GATE's component architecture led to long life
</li>
<li>
now we have ubiquitous networks and geographically distributed
    workforces
</li>
<li>
GLEAM's service-oriented architecture exploits distribution
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Gartner reports that
<ul>
<li>
<em>"By 2008, SOA will be a prevailing software engineering practice,
    ending the 40-year domination of monolithic software architecture"</em> 
</li>
<li>
<em>"Through 2008, SOA and web services will be implemented together in
    more than 75 percent of new SOA or web services projects."</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

SWSs and SOAs are poised to make a significant contribute to
  competitiveness of European ICT
</li>
<li>
This will happen in two ways:
<ol>
<li>
EAI less costly / more reliable via explicit modelling of meaning of
    data and processes
</li>
<li>
B2B and B2C eCommerce systems will become:
<ul>
<li>
more reusable: interfaces meaningful for machines, not just people;
</li>
<li>
more dynamic and adaptive, virtual apps composed from discovered
      components;
</li>
<li>
more scaleable, distributed across multiple machines;
</li>
<li>
saleable as discreet elements in application service providers market

<a name="3.3."><h3>3.3. Apps (3) The Return of the Librarian?</h3></a>


<p>
Some decades ago, if the chief engineer of a Sheffield steelworks needed to
know the value of some constant in the equations describing the mixture of
ingredients for a specialist job, he'd phone the city library. Even now, if
you work for a large corporation you may well be able to call on the
services of a skilled information scientist whose job is to know more about
navigating the published universe than any normal mortal could ever learn.

<p>
These skills are less and less available. The winding down of the welfare
state public service in favour of private profit has closed a thousand
libraries, and the information firehose has cheapened information to the
degree that the little query box on Google's search page has become the only
investigative tool for many.

<p>
Team annotation tools can be a means to make librarian services affordable
for small teams and organisations.
