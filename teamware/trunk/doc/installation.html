<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Introduction</h1>

<p>While the bundled tomcat6 is useful for running GATE Teamware in development
mode, in production systems you will probably need to deploy Teamware to a
standalone server.  The &quot;dist&quot; target in the top-level Teamware build file
produces a graphical installer that can be used to install teamware into an
existing Tomcat and MySQL setup, and the following sections of this document
describe the requirements that must be in place on the production server before
deploying Teamware, and the installation process itself.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>Requirements</h1>

<p>A server that will be hosting GATE Teamware requires the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A recent Java 6 JDK (Sun/Oracle or OpenJDK), 1.6.0<span class="cow-escape">_</span>14 or later.</li>
<li>An installation of Apache Tomcat 6 (Teamware should work with any Tomcat of
  version 5.5 or later but has been tested only with 6.0.x).
  <ul>
  <li>To work with the installer, the server configuration must use the default
    &lt;Engine&gt; name &quot;Catalina&quot; and the default &lt;Host&gt; name &quot;localhost&quot;.  If your
    tomcat does not use these names manual intervention will be required after
    the installer is run to rename the configuration files.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>A MySQL server, with a user account that has been granted &quot;ALL PRIVILEGES&quot; on
  a database.  The installer will create and populate this database during
  Teamware installation.</li>
<li>A directory to store the non-database persistent data for Teamware, which
  must be readable and writeable by the user account under which the Tomcat
  server runs.  The doc-service searchable datastore is stored here, which
  requires disk space up to ten times the total size of the documents stored.
  On a development system this defaults to ~/safe/{instancename}.</li>
</ul>

<p>The various components of Teamware need to communicate with one another at
runtime, so if your Tomcat is running behind a front-end proxy (typically
Apache HTTPD) then it is useful to configure a second non-proxy-aware
&lt;Connector&gt; in the Tomcat configuration so this inter-service communication can
go direct to localhost rather than having to go through the proxy server.  This
is especially important if the front-end proxy uses SSL.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Building the installer</h1>

<p>To build the GATE Teamware installer, start with a fresh checkout of the
relevant version of the Teamware source code.  It is especially important that
the <tt>tomcat6</tt> directory is <em>completely</em> clean and does not have any left-over
<tt><em>anything</em>-webapps</tt> directories or <tt>conf/Catalina/localhost</tt> configuration
files.</p>

<p>To build an installer for the default &quot;cloud-tw&quot; installation of GATE Teamware,
run:</p>

<pre>
ant -propertyfile install.properties dist
</pre>

<p>The installer will be placed in dist/install.jar.  To build an installer for an
installation other than the default cloud-tw, you need to provide additional
system property definitions to ant.  For the installation specified in
<tt>installations/myinstance</tt>, specify <tt>-Ddefault.instance.name=myinstance</tt>.  For
an installation specified by an instance directory that is <em>not</em> under the
<tt>installations</tt> directory you must additionally specify
<tt>-Ddefault.instance.project.dir=/path/to/myinstance</tt>.  Note that this is
different from installing a non-default instance into the bundled tomcat6 -
when building the installer you <b>must not</b> provide <tt>-Dinstance.name=...</tt>, as
the installer build uses a special dummy value for this property.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Installing Teamware</h1>

<p>To install GATE Teamware, copy the generated install.jar to the production
server and run it (using java -jar) as a user that has write permission to the
Tomcat directory and the intended data directory.  This will present a
graphical installer which will prompt you for various settings<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>.  The first
page asks for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The location of your Tomcat installation.  This is the top directory, i.e.
  the parent of of bin, conf, webapps, etc.</li>
<li>The instance name for the target installation.  Obviously, the services and
  settings installed will be those for the installation that was specified when
  the installer was built, but this option allows you to configure the context
  path under which the Teamware web applications will be deployed.  For
  example, setting this to &quot;customtw&quot; will make the executive available at
  <span class="cow-escape">h</span>ttp://someserver.com/customtw/executive/</li>
<li>The data directory described above, where the datastore and other
  non-database persistent data will be stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second page asks for the public and private <em>URL base</em> patterns.  These are
the protocol, host and port number (if required) at which your Teamware will be
visible, and must match the values configured for the Tomcat server.  The
public URL base is the URL which remote users will use to connect to Teamware.
For a standalone Tomcat this would be something like
<tt><span class="cow-escape">h</span>ttp://teamware.example.com:8080</tt>, for a Tomcat which is behind a front-end
Apache HTTPD it might be <tt><span class="cow-escape">h</span>ttp://teamware.example.com</tt> or
<tt><span class="cow-escape">h</span>ttps://secure.example.com</tt>.  The URL base <em>must not</em> have a trailing slash.</p>

<p>The <em>private</em> URL base is the URL that the teamware services use to talk to one
another, and will typically be <tt><span class="cow-escape">h</span>ttp://localhost:8080</tt> (or whatever port
number the non-proxied &lt;Connector&gt; is set to use).  If in doubt, use the same
value as for the public URL base.</p>

<p>The third page asks for the settings that Teamware should use to send out
notification emails to users, and the fourth page asks for details of the MySQL
database that Teamware should use.  As mentioned above, the username/password
combination you supply here must have ALL PRIVILEGES on the specified database
for the installer to be able to create the database schema.  You may be able to
restrict these privileges somewhat once Teamware is up and running but this is
not something that has been extensively tested.</p>

<p>The final page allows you to choose a custom logo and title to brand your
Teamware installation.</p>

<p>Once all options have been set, the installer will install the Teamware web
applications into your Tomcat, create the schema and install the initial data
into MySQL, and seed the persistent data directory with initial annotation
schemas, etc.</p>

<p>After the installation is complete you may need to change the permissions
and/or ownership of the persistent data directory, if you ran the installer as
a different user from the one that will be used to run Tomcat.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5. </span>Customizing the installer build</h1>

<p>There are a number of things you may wish to customize when building the
installer.  Using a non-default Teamware installation as the base for the
installer has been described above.  The other common customizations are to use
a custom code signing certificate for the Java Web Start JAR files, and to
configure Teamware to be able to run over https.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5.1. </span>Code signing</h2>

<p>GATE Teamware includes a number of Java Web Start applications, most notably
the manual annotation GUI.  For Java Web Start all the JAR files in the
application must be cryptographically signed, and when the user runs the app
they will be prompted to trust the signing certificate, and warned if the
certificate is not trusted or has expired.  If you are deploying Teamware in an
enterprise where you already use code signing for other applications you may
wish to sign the Teamware JWS applications with an existing trusted
certificate.</p>

<p>To do this, you need the private key and certificate in a JKS-format Java
keystore (see the keytool documentation for details).  The keystore must also
contain the chain of certificates from the issuer of the signing certificate up
to the relevant CA root certificate.  The following ant properties are used to
direct the build to use your signing certificate instead of the default one:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>keystore</tt> - the absolute path to the keystore file containing the signing
  key and certificate.</li>
<li><tt>alias</tt> - the alias of the signing key (i.e. its identifier in the keystore).</li>
<li><tt>storepass</tt> and <tt>keypass</tt> - the passphrases protecting the keystore itself
  and the key within the store respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can either specify these properties using <tt>-D</tt> command line options when
running ant, or by putting them in a properties file and pointing ant to that
file using a second <tt>-propertyfile</tt> argument.</p>
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5.2. </span>Configuring Teamware for HTTPS</h2>

<p>The web service toolkit used by the various Teamware components to talk to the
back-end services is able to communicate with https endpoints, but unlike a
regular web browser it does not trust any https server certificates by default.
Thus if your public URL base is an https URL, you need to provide configuration
when building the installer in order to allow the manual annotation GUI to
trust your server.</p>

<p>To do this, you must create a JKS keystore file containing the certificate of
the root CA that is the ultimate issuer of your https server's certificate
(i.e. if your certificate was signed by an intermediate authority A and that
certificate was issued by a root authority B then it is B's certificate you
need, not A's).  This keystore must have a passphrase set but as the store
should contain only trusted certificate entries (no private keys) this need not
be a secure password - &quot;password&quot; or &quot;changeit&quot; is perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>To point the build at this keystore, use the following system properties (as
<tt>-D</tt> options or in a propertyfile as described above):</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>https.truststore</tt> - the absolute path to the keystore file</li>
<li><tt>https.truststore.password</tt> - the keystore password</li>
</ul>
