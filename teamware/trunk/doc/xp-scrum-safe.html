<a name="section-1."/><h1>1. Tasks, people, how to get help</h1>

<p>If you want help of any sort, ask Valy. He loves answering questions and the
more we provide him with, the better pleased he'll be :-)</p>

<p>Alternatively, here is a rough breakdown of our main current work areas, with
a list of people (the first one being the main person responsible for that
area). Please use this to decide who to ask about a particular subject.</p>

<p>If you can't get the help you need, raise it as a problem in the scrum.</p>

<a name="section-2."/><h1>2. Notes about messenger meetings.</h1>

<p>These "meetings" are to help us coordinate and plan the
SAFE/matrixware work over the next several months. We have to demo the
results in 5 weeks and then complete the work by mid-december.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute you have to ask the chairperson first, so type a
"!". Then the chair will say "go ahead Ian" or whatever, and then you take
your turn. This is to make it easier to follow a single thread of discussion
without drowning each other out. Exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're commenting <b>within</b> the current thread then you can go ahead
  without asking.</li>
<li>If someone asks a question which is clearly for you or that you can answer
  then you can go ahead without asking.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>When you finish a contribution type "." or say "I'm finished" or similar.</p>

<p>Each time we have one of these chats we start by going around the group
and saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>what we did since the last meeting (in this case, what we're working
  on now)</li>
<li>what we plan to do next</li>
<li>any problems that we're having or anticipate</li>
</ul>

<p>Any problems that are reported should be recorded by the chair, and by the
person reporting them, and then when you make your next report you should
detail whether the problem was fixed or not.</p>

<p>Each person should be brief, and we should finish within half an hour
or less.  (Don't give details; if you need some more information about
a task then report that under the "problems" section and we'll agree
that a discussion with other team members should happen, probably with
a report back the day after.) The aim is to gradually reduce the
length of the meetings to around 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Please type your report before the meeting (keeping it short) and paste 
it in when your turn comes.</p>


<a name="section-3."/><h1>3. SCRUM/XP</h1>

<p>These notes attempt to identify a light-weight set of organisational practices
to help manage our expanded team. They are based on a few elements of XP and
Scrum.</p>

<p>XP is a way to keep focussed on user needs and to ensure stability through
testing. Scrum is a way to organise regular deadlines and to encourage
teamwork towards clearly defined objectives.</p>

<p>We already have a commitment to certain elements of XP and the forest of Agile
methods that have grown up around it. Some we're already good at, e.g. not
producing endless design artefacts. Some we're not so good at, e.g. always
testing, designing tests first, reviewing each others code, keeping a tight
delivery/evaluation loop with users.</p>

<p>Scrum is less about the code and more about how to split development time into
manageable chunks, how to structure implementation iterations, and how to
filter and prioritise ideas for new features and technical changes.</p>

<p>The main elements of XP and Scrum that are included here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test-driven development.</li>
<li>Deliver early, deliver often.</li>
<li>Only document where necessary (minimise design artefacts because they go out
  of date or cost lots to maintain).</li>
<li>Development done by self-organising teams.</li>
<li>Development done on a monthly cycle; no new work can be taken on by a team
  after a cycle starts. </li>
<li>The list of features, functions, technologies, enhancements and bug fixes
  that would ideally be performed are prioritised and listed in a "backlog"
  which represents a snapshot of the ever-changing requirements and plan.</li>
<li>For each development cycle pick the highest priority items to do next.</li>
<li>There are no bad ideas for new features, only low priority features.</li>
<li>Meet every 2 working days to briefly report: what's been done since last
  meeting; what is planned for next; what has been a barrier. These are called
  "scrums" and should last around 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case we have two developer teams: SAFE and SInS. (Lots of the products
from these teams go into GATE and ANNIE, of course, and are delivered into our
funded projects.)</p>

<p>The process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a prioritised list of functionality, technology changes, bug fixes
  etc.</li>
<li>Select a month's work.</li>
<li>Do a month's work (a "sprint").</li>
<li>Review.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>During a sprint new work items cannot be assigned to the developers', except
for urgent show-stopper bugs. (New items that are identified are added to the
backlog instead.) The team can reduce or increase the amount of work in the
sprint if it needs to, but tries to avoid reductions if possible.</p>

<p>As new functionality becomes available it is rolled into the applications and
user feedback sought.</p>

<p>Artefacts (one of each for SAFE and SInS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications. (Currently the MUSING demonstrator for SAFE and the wiki and
  project management systems for SInS.)</li>
<li>Backlog. This lists all new and changed functionality that we've decided we
  need to develop to improve the applications. Items at the top of the list
  should be detailed enough and fine-grained enough to be implemented.</li>
<li>Test suite. All the backlog items that the team produces are delivered as a
  set of tests.</li>
<li>User guide. This has to contain enough information for users to understand
  what the team outputs and to exploit it effectively.</li>
<li>Developer guide. This is written relatively informally as a set of notes
  that point into the test suite javadocs/java2html.</li>
<li>Documentation: the sequence is: vision; backlog to-do; backlog done, linked
  to developer or user documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Team members (drawn from HC, VT, KB, IR, NA, MA, TH, DD, JS, YL):</p>
<ul>
<li>IR (editor of the SAFE backlog, SAFE chief architect)</li>
<li>HC (editor of the SInS backlog, scrum meeting chair, documentation lead)</li>
<li>MA (SAFE and SInS chief developer)</li>
<li>TH (SAFE developer)</li>
<li>JS (SAFE and SInS developer)</li>
<li>DD (SInS developer)</li>
<li>VT (SInS chief architect)</li>
<li>KB (SAFE chief scientist, SInS lead customer)</li>
</ul>

<p>Meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Monday of the month: sprint end review, sprint backlog elements
  selection. (Changes when a sprint finishes early. Sprints can't finish late:
  if the work isn't complete when they end we just stop, replan, and start
  again.) A sprint end review looks at each backlog that was planned and asks
  "Do tests exist that cover this item, and do they succeed?" and "Is the
  customer using this, and if not then when?"</li>
<li>Monday/Wednesday/Friday bi-weekly and Tuesday/Thursday bi-weekly
  alternating: 4-4.15: SAFE team meeting, or "scrum"; 4.15-4.30: SInS team
  meeting. The team meeting is very short; each member summarises what they
  did since the last meeting, what they plan to do next, and anything that is
  a problem (technological, organisational, whatever).</li>
<li>Alternate Thursdays: management meeting (analyse problems raised in team
  meetings, check backlog priorities, review code).</li>
<li>As required: user meetings. When we're the users or when the users are
  remote we have to simulate them. In XP style new development should be
  rolled into the applications as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
