</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Success (1): Perseus</h2>


<p>
<!-- 
One simple kind of annotation that has been used in the Perseus digital
library is named entity annotation. This is where the dates -->
 are annotated. This allows
Perseus to do some of the things illustrated in these screen shots: at the
top there is a map of references to places in the literature, which can also
be graphed over time; below there is a new search tool that allows you to
specify particular people, or locations, etc.

<h2>Success (2): Flikr, Delicio.us</h2>


<p>
<!-- 
Another simple form of annotation -->

<ul>
<li>
Delicio.us
<ul>
<li>
shared bookmarks hosting service
</li>
<li>
exploiting redundancy in the web to generalise (cf. Google)

Flikr:
<ul>
<li>
photo tagging and publishing service
</li>
<li>
"solves" the image analysis problem
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Folksonomy: annotation as behaviour mining or DIY indexing
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Success (3): Innovantage, Garlik</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Innovantage: mining the web for employment vacancies
<ul>
<li>
search for vacancies from 150,000+ companies across all UK industry
    sectors
</li>
<li>
search for jobs by SIC code, location, job title, essential skills,
    salary, reference, contact etc.
</li>
<li>
uses ontology-based information extraction and conceptual search based on
    GATE and KIM from OntoText, (evaluated leading semantic annotation tool at
    eponymous ISWC 2005 workshop)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Garlik: who's saying what about me?
<ul>
<li>
Egg founder and CIO: Mike Harris, Tom Ilube
</li>
<li>
give individuals more power over their personal information

<h2>Why isn't semantic annotation more widespread? (1)</h2>


<p>
Most cases aren't as bounded as Perseus.
<ul>
<li>
<b>PrestoSpace</b> estimates AV archives at 

<table cellspacing="0" border="1">

<b>Carrier type</b>                  </td><td> <b># items</b>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why isn't semantic annotation more widespread? (2)</h2>


<p>
There aren't enough DIY cases
<ul>
<li>
Flikr and Delicio.us have tapped into obvious and widespread needs
</li>
<li>
Innovantage and Garlik hope to do the same
</li>
<li>
But: in many cases we don't have the necessary folk for a folksonomy
</li>
<li>
Broadcast archives, for example, are Catch-22: 
<ul>
<li>
don't know you need it until you use it,
</li>
<li>
can't use it until widespread need generates funding...
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why isn't semantic annotation more widespread? (3)</h2>


<p>
<b>Square Fish Syndrome</b>
<ul>
<li>
Imagine you're looking at a river under which a fish swims by
</li>
<li>
You can show the ripples and eddies
<ul>
<li>
to an artist and ask them to draw a fish
</li>
<li>
to a statistician and ask them to model a fish
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In both case you're liable to get a square fish
</li>
<li>
Human language processing can be done by
<ul>
<li>
linguists intuiting about grammar
</li>
<li>
machine learning creating statistical models
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Language is a surface phenomenon
</li>
<li>
This leads to...
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Specificity vs. Complexity Trade-off</h2>


<p>
<img align="center" src="../../sale/images/spec-vs-comp.png"  >
<ul>
<li>
Simple tasks: document clustering, full-text search, entities, simple
  descriptions
</li>
<li>
Complex tasks: relations and events, cross-document reference
</li>
<li>
Specific domains: chemical engineering job descriptions, football match
  reports
</li>
<li>
General domains: all news sites, a corporate intranet, the web
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The key problem: balancing complexity vs. specificity to achieve useable
accuracy.

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Annotation: the Missing Manual</h2>


<p>
<!-- 
Despite the breadth and depth of literature describing algorithms -->

<ul>
<li>
We have: lots of algorithms, data structures and evaluation protocols
</li>
<li>
We lack: clear statement of how to specify and implement new tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Needed, a methodology covering:
<ul>
<li>
how to decide if annotation is applicable to your problem
</li>
<li>
how to define the problem with reference to a corpus of examples
</li>
<li>
how to identify similarities with other problems and thence to estimate
  likely performance levels
</li>
<li>
how to design a balance of adaptation interventions for system setup and
  maintenance
</li>
<li>
how to measure success
</li>
</ul>

<p>
(I.e.: 
not "get this great new bit of software and it will transform your life",
but "this is how to implement robust and maintainable services".)

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>A Division of Labour (Multi-role Methodology)</h2>


<p>
We have tools for <b>Language Engineers</b>; we lack tools for:

<p>
<b>(Human) Annotators</b>
<ul>
<li>
training data volumes large: labour has to be cheap!
</li>
<li>
bootstrap annotation process with mixed-initiative learning 
</li>
<li>
voting mechanism for multiple simultaneous annotators
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Information Curators</b>
<ul>
<li>
larger skill set but small enough to be in-house
</li>
<li>
librarians, data curation or sys admin 
</li>
<li>
training course of a week or two
</li>
<li>
toolset including things e.g. ANNIC, JAPE
</li>
<li>
managing annotators, liaising with engineers
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Unifying Adaptation Interventions</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Problem: annotation systems are dynamic objects because the information
  need and the data don't remain static
</li>
<li>
Therefore we need mechanisms for adaptation
</li>
<li>
Three current disparate research streams:
<ul>
<li>
assisted authoring of finite state transduction rules, including:
    generation of rules from annotation pattern searches across corpora
    graphical debugging of transduction rule execution
</li>
<li>
supervised mixed-initiative learning of extraction models
</li>
<li>
unsupervised clustering of terms for purposes such as populating
    domain-specfic gazetteers or taxonomies
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Should be complementary, not competitive
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Assistive vs. Autonomous</h2>

<ul>
<li>
A modern factory engaged in the production of high-tech goods combines a
  large degree of automation with skilled labour of various types and
  quantities.
</li>
<li>
Robots often play a significant role, although they are never altogether
  unaccompanied:
<ul>
<li>
at the very least service engineers must attend their operation
</li>
<li>
in most cases there will also be staff who take care of reconfiguring
    robotic equipment for new product lines or refinements to the existing
    processes and products
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Factory approach: automatic where possible, assistive where necessary
<ul>
<li>
technology can make labour cheap enough
</li>
<li>
net helps access, cf. Amazon's Mechanical Turk
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Iterative Processes vs. Waterfall or "Big Bang"</h2>


<p>
How to construct a failing software project:
<ul>
<li>
work for the government (optional)
</li>
<li>
define your plan as:
<ul>
<li>
first we (highly-paid developers) decide what to build (requirements)
</li>
<li>
then we (middle-level developers) decide how to build it (design)
</li>
<li>
then we (lower-level developers) implement it (coding)
</li>
<li>
then we (support staff) deploy it (disaster)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A better model: iteration, XP, do something useful now and get it out there

<p>
The same with annotation: we need iterative methods that account for
changing needs and gradual refinement of requirements.

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Service-Orientated vs. Monolithic</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Software has evolved: modules, objects, components, now services
</li>
<li>
Gartner reports that
<ul>
<li>
<em>"By 2008, SOA will be a prevailing software engineering practice,
    ending the 40-year domination of monolithic software architecture"</em> 
</li>
<li>
<em>"Through 2008, SOA and web services will be implemented together in
    more than 75 percent of new SOA or web services projects."</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
EAI less costly / more reliable via explicit modelling of meaning of
  data and processes
</li>
<li>
B2B and B2C eCommerce systems will become:
<ul>
<li>
more reusable: interfaces meaningful for machines, not just people;
</li>
<li>
more dynamic and adaptive, virtual apps composed from discovered
    components;
</li>
<li>
more scaleable, distributed across multiple machines;
</li>
<li>
saleable as discreet elements in application service providers market
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>


</div><div class="slide">
<h2>Summary: from Annotation Tools to <em>Annotation Factories</em></h2>


<p>
We <b>have</b> lots and lots of tools and algorithms for annotation; what we
<b>need</b> is
<ol>
<li>
methodological instead of purely technological 
</li>
<li>
multi-role instead of single role
</li>
<li>
inclusive of previously disjoint adaptation interventions
</li>
<li>
assistive instead of autonomous
</li>
<li>
diachronic, life-cycle orientated, not waterfall or "big bang" orientated
</li>
<li>
service-orientated, not monolithic
</li>
</ol>
