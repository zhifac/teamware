<a name="section-1."/><h1>1. Architecture</h1>

<p>The GATE Service platform consists of two principal components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The web service <em>endpoint</em>, that accepts requests from clients and queues
  them for processing.</li>
<li>One or more <em>workers</em> that take the queued requests and process them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two sides communicate using the Java Messaging System (JMS), a framework
for reliable messaging between (possibly distributed) Java components.  The
standard implementation uses Apache ActiveMQ as the message broker, but the
code is not tied to any particular JMS provider.</p>

<p>In the simplest (and probably most frequent) case, the endpoint, messge broker
and the workers can run in the same JVM, but it is also possible to run each
component separately, either in several JVMs on the same physical machine, or
distributed over the network.  If a particular service is heavily loaded it is
a simple matter to add extra worker nodes to spread the load, and workers can
be added or removed dynamically without needing to shut down the web service.</p>

<p>The configuration and wiring together of these components is handled using the
<a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring framework</a>.  A number of standard
configurations are available but with a little knowledge of Spring you can wire
together complex combinations of workers and endpoints in a few XML files.</p>

<a name="section-2."/><h1>2. Defining a GATE Service </h1>

<p>The Java code making up the GaS is completely generic and will work for any
GATE application you wish to expose as a service.  A specific service is
configured with two files, first the <tt>.xgapp</tt> file defining the pipeline as
produced by saving the application state from GATE, and second a <em>service
definition</em> defining the input and output annotation sets required by the
service and any parameters the service takes.  These files are described in
this section.</p>

<a name="section-2.1."/><h2>2.1. The saved application state</h2>

<p>The GATE pipeline run by a service is typically defined by an <tt>.xgapp</tt> file,
created in the GATE GUI using "Save application state"<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>.  The application should be fully
configured before saving, i.e. all required runtime parameters should be set
(except possibly those that will be mapped to <em>required</em> service parameters, as
described in the next section).</p>

<p>The saved application should be as self-contained as possible, i.e. the plugins
used by the application should be in subdirectories under the saved application
location.  This is particularly important when the service is to be run in
all-in-one mode, as read permission on parent directories may be restricted by
the servlet container.</p>

<a name="section-2.2."/><h2>2.2. The service definition</h2>

<p>A GaS can declare required and optional parameters whose values are provided by
the caller.  The parameter values are mapped onto either feature values on the
document being processed by the embedded GATE PRs (useful in the case of a
conditional controller), or runtime parameter values of the various PRs
that make up the application.  The mapping is defined in a <em>service
definition</em>, an XML file supplied by the GaS creator:</p>
<pre>
&lt;parameters>
  &lt;param name="depth">
    &lt;runtimeParameter prName="MyAnnotator" prParam="maxDepth" />
  &lt;/param>
  &lt;param name="annotatorName">
    &lt;documentFeature name="annotator" />
  &lt;/param>
&lt;/parameters>
</pre>

<p>Parameter values are all strings, but when mapping to PR parameters the usual
GATE <tt>Resource.setParameterValue()</tt> is used, which can convert strings into
other types (e.g. URL, Integer, etc.).</p>

<p>The service definition also specifies what annotation sets the service requires
as input and populates as output:</p>
<pre>
&lt;annotationSets>
  &lt;annotationSet name="Original markups" in="true" />
  &lt;annotationSet name="" out="true" />
  &lt;annotationSet name="Key" in="true" out="true" />
&lt;/annotationSets>
</pre>

<p>Note that a service can use the same set for both input and output, and can use the default annotation set (the second example above).</p>

<a name="section-3."/><h1>3. Standard Configurations</h1>

<p>The Ant build file provided with the GaS can build several standard configurations of GaS:</p>
<ul>
<li>All-in-one - the endpoint, message broker and a worker node all packaged in
  one WAR file and running in one JVM.</li>
<li>Endpoint only - a WAR file that runs just the web service endpoint for a
  service.  It must be configured with the URL to a remote message broker, and
  workers must be run separately.</li>
<li>Standalone worker - a ZIP file containing an installation for a standalone
  worker node.  It must be configured with a URL to a remote broker, into which
  an endpoint is queuing jobs.</li>
</ul>

<a name="section-3.1."/><h2>3.1. All-in-one WAR file</h2>

<p>The <tt>war.complete</tt> Ant target creates a WAR file that will run a message
broker, service endpoint and one or more workers all within the same web
application context in a servlet container (e.g. Tomcat or Jetty).  Despite the
name, the WAR file generated is not quite complete, the following files must be
inserted to complete the deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>/WEB-INF/serviceDefinition.xml</tt> - the service definition for this service.</li>
<li><tt>/WEB-INF/application.xgapp</tt> - the saved application state.  Any plugins or
  resource files which this requires should also be added at the appopriate
  places under <tt>WEB-INF</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these files have been added to the WAR it should be deployable on any
Servlet 2.4 container (e.g. Tomcat 5.5, Jetty 6, etc.)</p>

<p>In addition, you may wish to edit <tt>/WEB-INF/gate-service.properties</tt> if you
want to run more than one worker to allow for parallel processing of requests.</p>

<p>Finally, <tt>/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties</tt> defines the logging configuration
for the service.  The default file logs all informative, warning and error
messages - when debugging you may wish to enable debug messages too.</p>

<a name="section-3.2."/><h2>3.2. Endpoint only</h2>

<p>The <tt>war.endpointonly</tt> target creates a WAR file that runs just the web service
endpoint for a service.  It expects to post jobs to a remote message broker,
and you will need to run one or more standalone workers to process the jobs.
The endpoint-only WAR file requires the addition of just
<tt>/WEB-INF/serviceDefinition.xml</tt> as described above.  In addition, you will
need to edit <tt>/WEB-INF/gate-service.properties</tt> and set the correct brokerURL
(typically <tt>failover:tcp://hostname:61616</tt>), and you may wish to configure
logging as above.</p>

<a name="section-3.3."/><h2>3.3. Standalone worker</h2>

<p>The <tt>dist.worker</tt> target creates a ZIP file which is a suitable installation
from which to run a set of standalone workers for a GaS.  You will need to add
the following files to the distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>gate-service-worker/conf/serviceDefinition.xml</tt> - the service definition.</li>
<li><tt>gate-service-worker/gate/application.xgapp</tt> - the saved application state.
  Plugins should be added here too.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also wish to edit <tt>gate-service.properties</tt> and <tt>log4j.properties</tt> in
the <tt>conf</tt> directory to set the broker location, number of workers and logging
configuration for the workers.</p>

<p>The workers are run using Ant: a <tt>build.xml</tt> file is provided in the
<tt>gate-service-worker</tt> directory, just run <tt>ant</tt> in this directory to run the
workers.</p>

<a name="section-4."/><h1>4. Advanced configuration</h1>

<p><em>This section assumes some knowledge of the Spring framework, and in particular
the Inversion of Control container and the format of bean definition XML
files.</em></p>

<p>The various components of a GaS are configured using Spring.  The standard
configurations described above are simply pre-defined Spring contexts
containing the relevant beans, which require minimal additional configuration
to be useable.</p>

<a name="section-4.1."/><h2>4.1. Endpoints</h2>

<p>The web service endpoint object for a particular GaS is instantiated by Axis.
However, the endpoint object itself is simply a thin wrapper around a Spring
bean, called the <em>endpoint handler</em>, that does the actual work.</p>

<p>When the GaS web application starts up it uses the standard Spring
<tt>ContextLoaderListener</tt> to load an ApplicationContext from a number of bean
definition files, typically stored in <tt>/WEB-INF/spring</tt>.  The Axis-managed
endpoint object then looks up the endpoint handler bean in this context under
the ID <tt>endpointHandler</tt>.  The <tt>endpointHandler</tt> bean is a prototype
(non-singleton) bean, of which several instances will be created by the Axis
service object to allow for multiple concurrent requests.</p>

<p>The usual endpoint handler is an instance of the class
<tt>gleam.gateservice.endpoint.GateWebServiceHandler</tt>, and takes the following
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>serviceDefinition</tt> - a <tt>gleam.gateservice.definition.GateServiceDefinition</tt>,
  typically created from an XML definition file by the
  <tt>GateServiceDefinitionFactoryBean</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>jmsConnectionFactory</tt> - the <tt>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</tt> used to connect to
  the message broker.</li>
<li><tt>queue</tt> - the <tt>javax.jms.Destination</tt> to which jobs are posted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creation of the connection factory and destination are JMS provider specific.
In a JEE application server they would come from JNDI but for ActiveMQ they can
simply be created as singleton beans in Spring.  See
<tt>/WEB-INF/spring/commonBeans.xml</tt> in a generated WAR file for an example.</p>

<a name="section-4.2."/><h2>4.2. Workers</h2>

<p>Workers are started by <tt>gleam.gateservice.worker.WorkerRunner</tt>, which takes a
Spring application context and looks for all beans of type
<tt>gleam.gateservice.worker.WorkerConfig</tt>.  Each WorkerConfig bean defines a set
of workers to run, and has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>connectionFactory</tt> - the JMS connection factory used to connect to the
  broker.</li>
<li><tt>queue</tt> - the Destination from which jobs are to be consumed.</li>
<li><tt>serviceDefinition</tt> - the service definition, typically created by
  <tt>GateServiceDefinitionFactoryBean</tt> as above.</li>
<li><tt>executiveProxyFactory</tt> - the <tt>gleam.executive.proxy.ExecutiveProxyFactory</tt>
  used to communicate with the executive.  If this set of workers will not
  service any GLEAM-mode requests, a dummy proxy may be used.</li>
<li><tt>docServiceProxyFactory</tt> - the
  <tt>gleam.docservice.proxy.DocServiceProxyFactory</tt> used to communicate with the
  document service.  A dummy may be used for a GATE-mode-only worker, as above.</li>
<li><tt>gateApplicationBeanName</tt> - the name of the prototype bean providing the GATE
  application to run.  Typically this will be defined using the GATE
  <tt>SpringFactory</tt>'s <tt>loadObjectFromResource</tt> method to load a <tt>.xgapp</tt> file,
  but a custom factory bean could be used instead.  Each worker started by the
  runner will receive a fresh copy of this application.</li>
<li><tt>numWorkers</tt> - the number of identical workers to start.</li>
</ul>

<a name="section-4.3."/><h2>4.3. Running workers in a web application</h2>

<p>To run workers in a web application, for example in the all-in-one case where
the workers run in the same webapp as the endpoint, there is a
<tt>ServletContextListener</tt> provided which creates a <tt>WorkerRunner</tt> and starts
workers defined by all the <tt>WorkerConfig</tt> beans in the Spring web application
context.  The listener must be declared in <tt>web.xml</tt>, <em>after</em> the Spring
<tt>ContextLoaderListener</tt>, as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;listener>
  &lt;listener-class>
    gleam.gateservice.worker.WorkerRunnerListener
  &lt;/listener-class>
&lt;listener>
</pre>

<p>The spring context must of course include all the beans required by the
WorkerConfigs...</p>

<a name="section-5."/><h1>5. Complex configurations - more than one service</h1>

<p>There is nothing to stop you running endpoints and/or workers for more than one
GaS in the same web application or JVM.  However, some additional configuration
is necessary.</p>

<a name="section-5.1."/><h2>5.1. Multiple endpoints in one webapp</h2>

<p>To run endpoints for multiple services in the same web application, you must
first create your Spring bean definitions such that the two independent
endpoint handlers are defined correctly under different bean IDs (say
<tt>serviceOneHandler</tt> and <tt>serviceTwoHandler</tt>).  In particular, the two handlers
<em>must</em> post their jobs to different JMS queues - either two different queues in
the same broker or two independent brokers.</p>

<p>Once this is done you must modify the Axis <tt>server-config.wsdd</tt> file in
<tt>WEB-INF</tt> and duplicate the <tt>service</tt> section defining the GATEService,
changing the service <tt>name</tt> attributes to distinguish between the two
services.  Then you must add a parameter to each service to tell it which
handler bean to use:</p>
<pre>
&lt;service name="ServiceOne" provider="java:RPC" ...>
 ...
 &lt;parameter name="scope" value="Application"/>
 &lt;!-- Use a different bean name for the handler -->
 &lt;parameter name="endpointHandlerBeanName" value="serviceOneHandler"/>
 ...
&lt;/service>
</pre>

<a name="section-5.2."/><h2>5.2. Multiple workers in one JVM</h2>

<p>This case is very simple - just define multiple independent WorkerConfig beans
in your Spring configuration, and all the defined workers will be run
automatically by the WorkerRunner.</p>
