Release Change: 0.11

1. Recreated DB:
    - Changed initial script so instead of users and managers, now there are annotators and curators.
    - The process definition is changed accordingly and uploaded.
    - Harvard users (leon and carlos) now have admin & curator roles.
    - Sheffield users: (hamish, kali, valy, ian and milan) have admin roles

2. Implemented  POOL mode of Annotator GUI, besides existing DIRECT mode.
    - Added "cancel" and "finish task" button in Annotator GUI
    - Restricted access to WF service to users with Annotator profile. They will launch Annotator GUI after login and take part in WF process from Annotator GUI itself.
    - However, by using direct mode, curators will be able to execute annotator task
  
3. Specific IE improvements
    - The mentions of the genes are now highlighted  only when there is only one mention of the particular gene in snippet.

4. Workflow Improvements
   -  Implemented real Task cancellation, so cancelled task is displayed in the list as "cancelled" instead of "completed" (useful for curators)
   -  Added Refresh button in task list
   - Displayed Document Name for Annotate and Review tasks inside dynamic form

5. Customized Main Menu (welcome page)
    - Annotators will see "Launch Annotator GUI" link which will  open Annotator GUI in pool mode.
    - Other profiles will see link Pending Tasks  linked to their task list page

6. Bug Fixes:
    - Solved problem with Apache timeout in case that a very big zip is uploaded on server.
      The AJAX progress indicators are introduced, so connection between Apache and browser is live all the time.
    - Fixed memory leak, so zip file with big number of documents can be uploaded. Tested with 1500.

7. Documentation
   - Updated Help section in Annotator GUI
   - Recorded new demo accompanied with Workflow demonstration scenario & explanations for easier following.
