Version 1.1: Beta (15.05.2009)

- deploy several instances of teamware
- make safe.pl start script as demon executed when LDC is started.
- fix redirection for templates (All-My views)
- in process monitoring implement annotator view (pie chart to show the work split by annotators)
- support Mihai's scenario for multilevel manual annotation 
- revise number of workers on LDC
- publish processes and results onto a community platform (probably Leonardo)
  - pretty unclear (expecting requirements)
- conclude from annotation exercises if workflow templates are valuable at all.

  
Matt: Not directly to MA:
- When viewing pre-processed annotations from GAS, annotation group called  
  "safe.preprocess". Needs to be "teamware.preprocess" or something similar
- Just a thought, but eventually, can Teamware be a two-part installation, with 
  a one-time downloadable desktop component (doc viewer/editor) that connects 
  directly with the server?  This would allow for a more robust viewer and 
  elimination of repeated download and install of the editor interface.
- Integration issue:  Can GATE Developer be modified to use zip file as new 
  corpus, like Teamware?  (Eliminates unpacking steps in going from Teamware to Developer)
